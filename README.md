# ECE143-Life-expectancy

Information about the aim and methods of our project can be found on "Group 5 Proposal.docx".

The main.ipynb file contains the main our project, which will show the work we have done. It will also be an example on how to use the classes we implemented. For the main function to work, it has to be in the same directory as the folder, "Files/"

Specs to run the main:   

OS: Windows 10 Pro was used to run the main.   

Python: Python 3.6.6 :: Anaconda, Inc.

Modules required: (latest versions)   
 - pygal   
 - pygal_maps_world
 - PyTorch 
 - conda-forge wordcloud
 - numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
 - from sklearn import decomposition
 - from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
 - from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
 - from Project.Data_Cleaning import clean_data
 - from Project.Map_Display.analysis_part1 import sortdata
 - from altair import Chart, load_dataset
 - import altair as alt
 
The modules/classes we created for the project are all stored under the "Project/" directory. Each subfolder in "Project/" has its own readme, giving brief information and stating the original author(s) of the code.
