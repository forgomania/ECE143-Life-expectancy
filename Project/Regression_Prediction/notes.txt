Try linear regression model, (if time is aviablable, try more?)
see what happens if we change one of some of the features and show them on the map.
Based on assumption that none of the other parameters matters to life expectancy , such as historical effects, culture, religion, politics. 
Purely rely on the data we have.
Maybe show predictions on the map? (in presentation slides.)
In which category of countries dose the model fit better?
